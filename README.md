# Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and...
DeepLearning.AI:

Week 1 Assignment: Housing PricesÂ¶

 you'll get a soft introduction to what Machine Learning and Deep Learning are, 
 and how they offer you a new programming paradigm, 
 giving you a new set of tools to open previously unexplored scenarios.  

# Learning Objectives :
Monitor the accuracy of the housing price predictions
Analyze housing price predictions that come from a single layer neural network
Use TensorFlow to build a single layer neural network for fitting linear models.

# Week 2: Implementing Callbacks in TensorFlow using the MNIST Dataset:
In the course you learned how to do classification using Fashion MNIST, 
a data set containing items of clothing. 
Now,similar dataset called MNIST which has items of handwriting -- the digits 0 through 9.
