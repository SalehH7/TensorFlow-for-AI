Week 1 Assignment: Housing PricesÂ¶

 you'll get a soft introduction to what Machine Learning and Deep Learning are, 
 and how they offer you a new programming paradigm, 
 giving you a new set of tools to open previously unexplored scenarios.  

# Learning Objectives :
Monitor the accuracy of the housing price predictions
Analyze housing price predictions that come from a single layer neural network
Use TensorFlow to build a single layer neural network for fitting linear models.

# Week 2: Implementing Callbacks in TensorFlow using the MNIST Dataset:
In the course you learned how to do classification using Fashion MNIST, 
a data set containing items of clothing. 
Now,similar dataset called MNIST which has items of handwriting -- the digits 0 through 9.

# Learning Objectives
Use callback functions for tracking model loss and accuracy during training,
Make predictions on how the layer size affects network predictions and training speed,
Implement pixel value normalization to speed up network training,
Build a multilayer neural network for classifying the Fashion MNIST image dataset.
