Week 1 Assignment: Housing PricesÂ¶

 you'll get a soft introduction to what Machine Learning and Deep Learning are, 
 and how they offer you a new programming paradigm, 
 giving you a new set of tools to open previously unexplored scenarios.  

# Learning Objectives:
Monitor the accuracy of the housing price predictions
Analyze housing price predictions that come from a single layer neural network
Use TensorFlow to build a single layer neural network for fitting linear models.
